# Marati-NMT
In the project using the [Marathi-English dataset](http://www.manythings.org/anki/) we implemented a seq-seq attention based model using the [fairseq](https://fairseq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) model. For tokenization, I have made use of Moses script and subword segmentation for Byte-Pairng.

The mr-en.ipynb contains all the relevant code and the prepare_data.sh deals with the data preprocessing
